								<p>The Ferry Building Marketplace is the only place in the Bay Area – other than Acme’s original Berkeley location – that carries the full selection of Acme’s nationally acclaimed artisan breads. Steve Sullivan, founder and owner, says that after all these years Acme’s foremost goal remains the same – to bake outstanding bread. Acme uses only organic flour and works closely with farmers in evaluating and selecting the grain varieties for its flour each year.  Three shifts of bakers work around the clock, seven days a week at the Berkeley bakery in order to meet customer demand. At the Ferry Building Marketplace, breads are baked fresh through out the day in the hearth oven.</p>
								<p>Sullivan became interested in baking bread 25 years ago as a busboy at Berkeley’s famous Chez Panisse restaurant where he worked while attending the University of California at Berkeley. He started baking bread as a serious hobby after being inspired by Elizabeth David’s cookbook “English Bread and Yeast Cookery.” At Alice Waters’s request he went on to bake bread in the Chez Panisse kitchen. In 1983 he and his wife, Suzie, opened their first – now legendary – bakery.</p>
