								<p><strong>Ferry Plaza Farmers Market hours, 10 AM – 2 PM Tue/Thu – 8 AM – 2 PM Sat.</strong></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ferry Plaza Farmers Market is a California certified farmers market operated by CUESA (Center for Urban Education about Sustainable Agriculture). It is open three days a week on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, year round, rain or shine. The large <span data-term="goog_288334033">Saturday</span> market is held in the back plaza overlooking the Bay, along the south side of the building, and in front of the building along the Embarcadero. The <span data-term="goog_288334034">Tuesday</span> and <span data-term="goog_288334035">Thursday</span> markets take place in front of the building. All three weekly markets offer produce and flowers from top Bay Area farms, many of which are organic. A wealth of other product includes regional meat, seafood, and artisanal specialties — such as breads, cheeses, and jams — as well as street food offerings for brunch and lunch.</span></p>
								<p>On Saturdays, 30,000 shoppers, locals and travelers alike, attend the market. More than 300 Bay Area restaurants shop at the market on a weekly basis. CUESA’s mission is to cultivate a sustainable food system, giving preference to local farmers that use sustainable methods, and prepared food vendors who source ingredients from those farmers. CUESA hosts about 70 farmers and 50 artisan and prepared food vendors, some of which are seasonal. On Saturdays, CUESA offers free cooking demos and public education programs at the CUESA Classroom tent in front of the building.</p>
