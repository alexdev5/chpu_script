								<p>Providing pure, raw, premium honeycomb and honey products, straight from the hive, is what Carmel Honey Company is known for. Nothing has been added to or taken from the honey and that’s why our single source varietals, honeycomb and bath &amp; beauty products are sought after by honey connoisseurs and top chefs throughout the country. Our honey is always 100% pure, raw, unheated and unfiltered.</p>
								<p>Carmel Honey Company was founded by Jake Reisdorf at the age of 11. What began as a school project has now quickly turned into a “sweet” family business. Jake not only founded the company, but is a passionate advocate for saving honey bee populations. He’s a knowledgeable speaker who regularly gives talks, demonstrations and workshops to schools, civic groups, companies and nonprofits on the importance of bees and through his “Jake Gives Back” program makes and annual donation to a honey or bee related research organization each year. So when you make a purchase from Carmel Honey Company you’re also saving the honey bee.</p>
